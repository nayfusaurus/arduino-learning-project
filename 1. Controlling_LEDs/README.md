# Controlling LEDs

By using a potentiometer, and reading its analog values to toggle which LEDs light up according to its variable resistance.

More info on Potentiometer [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/potentiometer).

# Notes

By convention attach the cathode (short leg) of each of the LEDs to ground through a 220-ohm resistor. Note that the resistor can be on either side of the LED, but it **must** be present. When two or more components are in series, the current will be the same through all of them, and so it doesn't matter which order they are in.
